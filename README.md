# ruby_binary_search_tree
A binary search tree made in Ruby.

A binary search tree takes an array of sorted and unique numbers and sorts them into a tree structure. In this structure the middle number is the center or root. and then the numbers to the left of the center are divided in half where the root of that group is chosen (the same is done with the right). This process is contiued with each root getting children and those children getting children until the array is out of numbers. A number to the left should always be less than its parent and a number to the right should always be greater than its parent. This project went a lot smoother than creating a linke list because many of those ideas carried over to this. The ideas and usefulness of queues eluded me for a time but eventually I saw the light and all was well. Deleting nodes was alson difficult because it requiered many contingencies based on what was being deleted. This project still gave me some trouble but it certainly went smoother than linked lists did at the start.
